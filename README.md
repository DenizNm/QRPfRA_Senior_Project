# QRPfRA Senior Project Repo
Quadruped Research Platform for Robotic Applications

## What This Project Currently Includes
- MuJoCo definition of the open source [SpotMicro](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) robot parts with proper joint positions and limits.


## What Is Going To Be Added To This Project
- Creating an embedded system for data acquisition form sensors such as IMU and ultrasonic sensor. (NOTE: force sensors for each foot can be added later)
- Rasberry Pi 4B 8Gb integration as brain of the system.
- Monocular Depth estimation using Rasberry Pi camera. Models like (ZoeDepth)[https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth] can be used, or custom model can be trained through (iPhone App)[https://github.com/DenizNm/Open-Quadruped-and-3D-Mapper] (written in Swift). (original repo)[https://github.com/Olament/DepthDetection].
- Reinforcement learning (RL) based controller definition in tensorflow.
- Inverse kinematics model with simple ANN. (Inv. kin. form forward kin.)
