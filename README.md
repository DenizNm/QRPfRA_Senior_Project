# QRPfRA: Quadruped Robot Platform for Research Applications

## About the Project
This project develops a low-cost, modular quadruped robot to enhance accessibility to robotics education and research. Leveraging the open-source SpotMicro design, the robot is engineered with three degrees of freedom per leg, using readily available servo motors and a Raspberry Pi 4B for computation. It incorporates a 9-DoF IMU and a Raspberry Pi camera for environmental sensing and navigation. The control and processing software, built in Python, utilizes TensorFlow/TFLite and OpenCV for tasks such as motion planning and image processing.

## Features
- **Cost-Effective Design:** Utilizes off-the-shelf components to maintain affordability.
- **Modular and Scalable:** Easy to modify and extend, perfect for educational purposes.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Combines mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.
